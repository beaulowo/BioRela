# BioRela
Comparing relationships of several species with biological classification system
## The Goal of This Project
This project is a fusion of biology and programming. In this project, I will make a C program that determines several species biological relationships
### Biological backgrounds
* What does "relationships" means?
> A creature of similar ancestry and used in classifying. It is said that if a similar species of reproductive relationship occurs, the relationship is close, and if not, the relationship is far away. From an evolutionary point of view, the first cells are all said to be in a relationship of flexibility.
